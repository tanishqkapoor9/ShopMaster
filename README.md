# ShopMaster
 ShopMaster is a simplified e-commerce system that enables users to manage products, orders, and payments. Users can create orders, add multiple products, and process payments. It also includes an inventory management system that tracks stock levels, processes orders, and triggers restocking alerts when stock falls below a set threshold.
